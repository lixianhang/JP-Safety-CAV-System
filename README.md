# JP-Safety-CAV-System
Our project is designed to solve the accident problem. 
My solution is to use the IoT tech and automatical mapping and driving for searching and rescuring. 
Our purpose is to build a complete system including the cloud platform , the hardware(represent the vehicles)and the mobile app. 
The essensial parts is connected within  the Internet. 
When people registers their accounts in our software ,we bounds that plate with their imformation. 
If the emergency car detect the number of license plate and brand of a car in accident, it will get the information from the database. 
So we need build a web server at our cloud platform, and database. 
The client will be set up as an APP. It can estabilish the real-time location and even the images of the accident transmitted by the camera. 
As for the cloud platform , the protocols and the data processing should be considered well.
